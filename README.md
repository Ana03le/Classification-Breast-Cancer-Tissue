# Classification-Breast-Cancer-Tissue
Classification of Breast Cancer Tissue : Implemented the non-trivial function approximation problem for the UCI data set.
Designed the neural network with input layer of 9 neurons, hidden layer of 18 neurons and output layer with 1 neuron.
This neural network classifies whether lump is benign or malignant type of breast cancer from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.
